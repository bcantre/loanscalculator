# loanscalculator
Programming Task for Hoegh

This is a Loans Calculator Web Application that is build using Spring MVC with an embedded Apache Tomcat servlet container. The project uses Thymeleaf for server side templating of dynamic contents.

I have converted the loans calculator logic from the given github resource from JavaScript into Java so I can use it as a Java business handler being invoked by a Spring managed service for reusability and extensibility. However, there are calculation discrepancies in output between the original code and this web app and I have yet to investigate the cause of the discrepancies.

Please refer to the wiki document for the full documentation of the project.
